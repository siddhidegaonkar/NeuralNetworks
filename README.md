Neural Networks
The Objective is to do 5-fold cross validation to find good neural network parameters including the structure to report the CV accuracies. Then use those good parameters for training neural networks. I have to use NeuralNet class on Diamond regression dataset. 
Then I have summarized  the nonlinear logistic regression model and finished the NeuralNetLogReg class.
Applied the code with toy synthetic data and Bank-Marketing Classification Dataset.

**Scope **
1. Introduction to Regression Data
2. 5-fold Cross Validation
3. Results of Cross Validation
4. Nonlinear Regression
5. Nonlinear Logistic Regression
